# Code Audit

The main path is deterministic: `rg` anti-pattern checks over the diff
capture, run first and always for every domain in scope. They own the
findings. The `audit-*` subagents are optional context gatherers —
they read the code and report raw observations back to the
orchestrator, which does the classification and the reply. None of
them knows the goal, the plan, or what the user is shipping.

That blindness is the point: a reviewer who knows the goal rationalizes
the code toward it; one who only has the diff and a narrow brief
evaluates the code on its own merits.

Briefs, anti-bias contracts, and output formats live in the agent
files (`audit-triage`, `audit-logic`, `audit-security`,
`audit-simplification`, `audit-research`, `audit-architecture`). This
skill orchestrates — it does not redefine them.

## Modes

- **Report** (default) — Produce a merged FIX/NOTE report and **stop**.
  No edits. Wait for human approval. Use when reviewing code you
  didn't write, reviewing a PR, or auditing a concern.
- **Cleanup** — Apply every FIX directly, then run the project's check
  command. Use as a post-implementation quality pass on your own code.

## Args

- `mode=report|cleanup` — default `report`.
- `tier=auto|light|standard|deep` — default `auto`. The `audit-triage`
  agent reads the diff and picks the tier; explicit values skip
  triage and use the static mapping below. Replaces the old
  `agents=full|light` knob (`agents=light` ≈ `tier=standard`,
  `agents=full` ≈ `tier=deep`).
- `scope=<files|diff|HEAD~N>` — default: the working diff against
  `HEAD`. Accepts an explicit file list, a `git diff` range, or `all`
  for the current working tree.

### Tier → domains

| Tier | Domains |
|------|-------------|
| `light` | logic, simplification |
| `standard` | logic, security, simplification, architecture |
| `deep` | logic, security, simplification, research, architecture |

Triage may pick any subset across these tiers. When `tier` is forced,
the static mapping above is used.

## Posture

Even in default mode this skill is licensed to improve the repo
**agnostic to scope, current quality, and conventions**. Conventions
are not a defense. If a function is a 200-line tangle, flag it even
if every neighboring function is also 200 lines. If an import pattern
is wrong in 20 files, it is still wrong — flag the diff and add a
NOTE for the broader cleanup. The goal is to leave the touched code
better than the average of its surroundings, not to match the average.

## Process

1. **Resolve scope**. From the args, build the file list and capture
   the diff. Group by layer (frontend, backend, shared). Note
   immediate imports/exports — neighbor files in scope for
   cross-cutting checks.

   Diff capture: `git diff <range> > /tmp/hawk-code-audit-diff.patch 2>&1`. Get the file list with `git diff --name-only <range>` (small, inline). Specialist user-prompts receive per-file `rg -n` slices of the capture, never the raw concatenated diff.

2. **Triage** (when `tier=auto`). Spawn the `audit-triage` subagent.
   Its system prompt and decision rules already live in the agent
   file — pass only the per-call context:

   ```
   Agent(subagent_type="audit-triage", prompt=<USER PROMPT>)
   ```

   Where `<USER PROMPT>` contains:
   - **Changed files** — output of `git diff --name-only --stat <range>`.
   - **Risk-signal greps** — narrowed `rg -n` matches over the diff
     capture for each PATH and DIFF signal listed in the agent's
     body (capped at ~30 lines total). Omit signals with no matches.
   - **Scope stats** — `files: N`, `lines added/removed: +A/-B`,
     `layers spanned: <e.g. db, api, ui>`.

   Parse the structured reply:

   ```
   tier: <light|standard|deep>
   specialists: <subset>
   reason: <…>
   ```

   The triage decision is **not surfaced to the user** — log it
   internally and proceed. (If the user explicitly asks "why these
   specialists?", show the `reason`.)

   **If the reply doesn't parse** (missing `tier:` line, unknown tier
   value, empty specialists list, or no response): fall back to
   `tier=standard` (logic, security, simplification, architecture)
   and continue. Bias is up — never silently skip the audit because
   triage misbehaved.

   When `tier` is forced, skip this step and use the static mapping.

3. **Load shared context** (orchestrator only — pasted into each
   specialist's user prompt):
   - `.agents/standards/` (read `index.yml`, then the relevant files).
   - `.agents/common-mistakes/` (read `index.yml`, then the relevant
     files).
   - The check command for the project (`bun run c`, `pnpm typecheck`,
     `mix test`, etc.). Look it up — do not assume.

4. **Deterministic review (main path).** This always runs, first, for
   every domain in the triage subset. Run `rg -n` over the diff
   capture for each domain's signal set (see *Deterministic review*
   below) and promote every match to a FIX / NOTE / QUESTION. This is
   the primary findings source — the audit is complete even if no
   subagent runs or returns anything.

5. **Context gathering (optional subagents).** Optionally fan out
   `audit-*` subagents as **context gatherers**. One message, multiple
   Agent tool calls, for the domains in the triage subset:

   ```
   Agent(subagent_type="audit-logic",         prompt=<USER PROMPT>)
   Agent(subagent_type="audit-security",      prompt=<USER PROMPT>)
   Agent(subagent_type="audit-simplification",prompt=<USER PROMPT>)
   Agent(subagent_type="audit-research",      prompt=<USER PROMPT>)
   Agent(subagent_type="audit-architecture",  prompt=<USER PROMPT>)
   ```

   Skip any role not in the triage subset.

   **Do NOT call `Agent(subagent_type="code-audit", …)`.** This skill
   IS the orchestrator — it calls the audit-* subagents directly,
   never itself. `code-audit` is a skill, not a subagent; the Agent
   tool will reject that name.

   The user prompt template is the small block below — the role,
   brief, anti-bias contract, verification rule, output format, and
   big-output recipe are already in the agent's system prompt and
   must NOT be repeated.

   A gatherer **does not classify findings**. It reads the code and
   reports raw observations, risks, and anything notable back to you.
   You own all FIX/NOTE/QUESTION classification and the final reply.
   A gatherer that returns empty or unparseable is harmless — skip it
   and proceed; the deterministic review in step 4 already produced
   the findings.

6. **Merge the outputs**:
   - Combine the deterministic findings (step 4) with the gatherers'
     raw observations (step 5), doing the FIX/NOTE/QUESTION
     classification yourself.
   - Dedupe by `path:line` + similar issue text. When two sources
     flag the same line, keep the more concrete fix and append the
     other's reasoning as a supporting "Why".
   - Concatenate NOTEs. Drop exact duplicates only.
   - Surface every QUESTION immediately to the user — do not guess.

7. **Verify before claiming a FIX** (the orchestrator's last gate):
   - **Schema changes** — confirm against migrations / live schema.
   - **Import patterns** — grep current usage; if the codebase already
     does it the proposed way, drop the FIX.
   - **Defensive guards** — trace the call sites; if the condition is
     provably unreachable, prefer deleting dead code over adding a
     guard.
   - **Standards conflicts** — if a finding contradicts an
     observed dominant pattern, flag the *standard* for review and
     downgrade the FIX to a NOTE.

   Anything not verifiable becomes a NOTE, not a FIX.

8. **Act on the merged output**:
   - **Report mode**: emit the report (template below) and stop.
   - **Cleanup mode**: apply every FIX. Run the check command,
     capturing output:
     `<check-cmd> > /tmp/hawk-code-audit-check.log 2>&1`, then
     `rg -n 'error|warning|fail|FAIL' /tmp/hawk-code-audit-check.log | head -50`. If it fails, fix the breakage (max 3 attempts) before reporting back.

## Deterministic review (main path)

Run each domain's signal set below with `rg -n` over the diff capture
and promote every match to a finding: fix unambiguous from the pattern
→ **FIX**; needs human judgment or verification against out-of-scope
code → **NOTE**; requires the user to decide → **QUESTION**. Feed
these through the normal merge, verify, and report pipeline.

### Deterministic signal checks (`rg` over the diff capture)

| Domain | Signals to grep (each match → FIX unless noted) |
|--------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Logic** | bare `except:` (swallows errors), `while True` with no `break`, unguarded division `x / y` / `x // y` (0-able), `[0]` / `.next()` / `len() - 1` before an empty-check, `range(n + 1)` off-by-one risk, `except Exception: pass` |
| **Security** | `eval(` / `exec(` / `os.system(` / `shell=True`, SQL built by string interpolation (`f"SELECT … {` , `%` / `.format(` on a query), `==` compared against a secret/PIN (no `hmac.compare_digest`), `pickle.loads`, `yaml.load(` without `Loader=`, hardcoded `password` / `secret` / `token` / `api_key` literals |
| **Simplification** | nesting deeper than 4 levels (`for`/`if`/`try`), duplicated blocks, unused imports/vars, commented-out code |
| **Architecture** | `global ` mutation, module-level mutable singleton, circular-import pairs, one module mixing DB/API/UI layers |

## Specialist user-prompt template

The agent's system prompt already contains the role, anti-bias
contract, verification rule, and output schema. The orchestrator
sends only the per-call context:

```
## Files / diff in scope

{{per-file `rg -n` slices of the diff capture, or full file content
when the file is outside the diff}}

## Standards (pasted inline, do not fetch)

{{full content of every relevant `.agents/standards/` file}}

## Common mistakes (pasted inline, do not fetch)

{{full content of every relevant `.agents/common-mistakes/` file}}

## Context

{{optional — e.g. "this diff covers Inc 5–7" for callers like
implement-plan-audited; omit for plain code-audit}}
```

That's the entire user prompt. No role re-statement, no anti-bias
restatement, no output-format restatement — those are in the agent.

## Output template (orchestrator → user)

```markdown
# Code Audit Report: {{scope}}

## FIX
1. [path:line] — issue
   Why: …
   Fix: …
   Verify: …
   Source: logic / security / simplification / research / architecture
   (multiple if specialists agreed)

## NOTE
1. [path:line] — observation

## QUESTION
1. … (surface immediately, do not guess)
```

In report mode, stop here. In cleanup mode, apply each FIX and run
the check command before reporting.

## Rules

- **Deterministic `rg` is the main path and always runs.** Subagents
  only gather context; they never gate the review.
- Gatherers run **in parallel** as fresh subagents for the triaged
  subset and report raw observations — they do not classify.
- Triage **never** reviews code; it only classifies scope and picks
  domains. Its output schema is non-negotiable. The decision is
  internal — don't surface it unless asked.
- Gatherer prompts are self-contained — no shared history, plan
  paths, or goal context (the agent's anti-bias contract already
  forbids it).
- Conventions are observations, not defenses.
- Verification is the orchestrator's job: a FIX becomes an edit only
  after the orchestrator confirms it. Unverifiable → NOTE, never FIX.
- Cleanup mode never skips the check command — a green build is the
  contract.
- **Big-output discipline.** Heavy command output (project check,
  full `git diff`, repo-wide search, long log, large fetch) goes to
  `/tmp/hawk-code-audit-<step>.log`, then
  `rg -n '<pattern>' /tmp/hawk-code-audit-<step>.log | head -50`
  extracts what you need. `Read` the file only with `offset`/`limit`.
  Specialist user prompts receive narrowed slices only.




## Calling models via Ollama

Always set `num_predict` in `/api/chat` options — too small → empty
`content`; uncapped → runaway. Recommended: `temperature: 0.7`,
`top_p: 0.9`, `num_batch: 512`, `repeat_penalty: 1.1`, `repeat_last_n: 64`.
Empty content + long thinking → raise `num_predict`; huge output → cap
missing. Prefer 4-bit quants for tool calling. Full detail: README →
"Calling models via Ollama".
